# Matlab-
I'd like to warmly thank two of the greatest programers that I have met through my short life so far. 
Dr Maysam Shahedi (DicomReader.m, makeImIsoRGB.m, experiment.m) from University of Texas, Dallas and Dr Image Analyst (difference plots.m, ruller2.m) 
from Mathworks community. Without their contribution, my scripting experience would be very poor. Region_seg.m retrieved from Mathworks repository 
where I edit a few of its parameters.
